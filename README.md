This project implements a market-neutral statistical arbitrage framework
using cointegration-based pair selection and daily rolling parameter
re-estimation with stop-loss controls.

## Methodology
- Cointegration-based pair selection
- Rolling hedge ratio and spread estimation
- Volatility-adjusted entry and exit rules
- Walk-forward train/validation/test framework
- Portfolio construction across multiple validated pairs

## Results
The strategy is evaluated using cumulative returns and risk-adjusted
metrics such as the Sharpe ratio under realistic transaction cost
assumptions.
